# Overview

This project demonstrates understanding of advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance, abstract classes and virtual methods.
as well as C# syntax such as (condition ? if true : if false).
It is a learning project, which was created out of my passion for programming and sports alike.
This project uses GitHub's official Visual Studio '.gitignore' to keep the repository clean.
